[{"text": "Welcome to the abacus! You can close the challenge window at any time and click on the number to see what it looks like on the abacus. To start, move one bead in the bottom right up to the top.", "target": 1,"solution":"This represents the number 1, as you can see below the abacus."},
{"text": "Now move 4 beads in the bottom right up to the top.", "target": 4,"solution":"This represents 4."},
{"text": "When we get to 5 in any column, we move the lower beads in the column down and one upper bead in the column down to represent 5. Try it out!", "target": 5,"solution":"The lower beads represent one times the power of that column. The upper beads represent five times the power of that column."},
{"text": "When we need to add more numbers, we just move over to the next left column. Try adding 1 bead from the next column to make 15.", "target": 15,"solution":"Each column represents 10 times the previous column, from right to left."},
{"text": "Try showing 123 on the abacus.", "target": 123,"solution":"The more columns you have, the bigger numbers you can show."},
{"text": "Try showing 12345 on the abacus.", "target": 12345,"solution":"Each column represents 10 times the previous column."},

{"text": "You can use an abacus to add and subtract numbers. Enter the first number: 6", "target": 6,"solution":""},
{"text": "Now, add 5 by moving the beads to represent one in that column, and 1 in the next column.", "target": 11,"solution":"We add by starting at the leftmost column and moving right, carrying to the left when the added numbers in a column are greater than 10."},
{"text": "Try adding 17 and 45.", "target": 62,"solution":"Remember to move one 5 bead down instead of 5 smaller beads up when you have to add a 5."},
{"text": "Try solving 495 + 416.", "target": 911,"solution":"By following this pattern, you can add really large numbers together."},

{"text": "Subtracting is the same as adding on an abacus, but instead of adding beads on the left, we subtract beads on teh left when the difference of the two numbers in a column is greater than 10. Try subtracting 8 from 17", "target": 9,"solution":""},
{"text": "Try solving 76-34", "target": 42,"solution":"I think you're starting to get the hang of it!"},
{"text": "Solve 653 - 412", "target": 241,"solution":"As long as you enter the larger number first, you can subtract large numbers on the abacus."},
